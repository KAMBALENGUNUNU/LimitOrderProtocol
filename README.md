Welcome to **Enhanced TWAP Limit Order Protocol**, a cutting-edge submission for the 1inch Limit Order Protocol Hackathon. Built on a **forked Ethereum mainnet**, this project pushes the boundaries of decentralized trading by introducing advanced strategies and custom extensions to the 1inch Limit Order Protocol (LOP). Our solution delivers a robust, secure, and highly extensible smart contract framework that empowers users with sophisticated trading strategies like TWAP, grid trading, vesting payouts, gasless transactions, and conditional ordersâ€”all seamlessly integrated with 1inch's powerful infrastructure.

This project reflects months of dedicated development, with a consistent commit history showcasing iterative improvements, rigorous testing, and a commitment to excellence. Our goal? To impress the judges with a professional, feature-rich protocol that redefines onchain trading.
